<ul>
                                <li>
                                  3. Go to <strong>Content > Blocks > Add New Block</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  4. Each section has to be created as CMS block and block name should respect the following format:

<strong>fullpagescroll_cmspageurlkey_sectionorder</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  5. The page identifier(cmspageurlkey) that you need when creating CSM blocks can be found in Page Description -> Search Engine Optimisation Tab -> URL Key. Page Url key is created automatically based on Page Title. Using this url key you associate the blocks to the page.
Note1: Identifiers, page url, section name are case sensitive. In case the blocks do not show up in the page, make sure to verify this first.

Note2: If the page will be used for homepage you need to use the following format, where ‘home’ is mandatory to be used and ‘storeviewcode’ is the store code where that homepage will be used.

<strong>fullpagescroll_home_storeviewcode_sectionorder</strong>
                                </li>
                                 <li>
                                  6. All the blocks are ordered by section order, alphabetic or by numbers.
For example: Summer1; Summer2; Summer3; Summer4 are ordered by numbers. Spring; Summer; Autumn; Winter will be alphabetically ordered: Autumn; Spring; Summer; Winter.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  7. When you want to insert a image as a background in the block, keep in mind that the first image that you upload will be automatically set as background.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  8. For the rest of the images or content you can use default editor settings.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                9. Make sure you set the page layout as ‘Fullscreen’, if the layout is set otherwise it will affect the Header, Footer and page functionality.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  10. After you created all the blocks(one block for each section), take a look on the page that you initially created with the full page scroll functionality. You can see that all the sections are alphabetically or numerically ordered using the “sectionorder” identificator.
                                </li>
